Groundwater contamination with arsenic is a serious problem in many parts of the
world, and can have severe health consequences for those who consume it. In this
project, we aim to predict the arsenic content in groundwater using artificial neural
networks (ANN), specifically backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and Whale
Optimization Algorithm (WOA).The project involves collecting data on arsenic levels in
groundwater from various locations, along with information on environmental factors
that may affect the arsenic content. The data is then preprocessed to clean and
transform it, and split into training and testing datasets.We use BPNN and WOA to
build prediction models based on the training dataset. BPNN is a commonly used neural
network model for regression and classification tasks, while WOA is a nature-inspired
optimization algorithm that can be used to optimize the weights and biases of the neural
network.The performance of the BPNN and WOA models is then evaluated using the
testing dataset, and compared against each other to determine which method yields
better results. We also evaluate the impact of different input variables on the prediction
accuracy of the models.The results of this project can have important implications for
water management and public health, as accurate prediction of arsenic levels in
groundwater can help prevent exposure to this toxic element. Furthermore, the use of
advanced machine learning techniques like ANN and WOA can provide insights into
the complex relationships between arsenic content and environmental factors, and may
lead to the development of more effective strategies for managing groundwater
resources.
